There once was a man named Eddie. He went to the grocery store in Madison, WI.
It was raining so hard outside.

He bought pancakes with the goal of making waffles with the pancake mix.
A questionable goal, but his determination was unfaltering.
With pancake mix in hand he approached the cash register as thunder boomed
in the background.
