There once was a man named Eddie. He went to the grocery store in Madison, WI.
It was raining so hard outside.

He bought pancakes with the goal of making waffles with the pancake mix.
A questionable goal, but his determination was unfaltering.
With pancake mix in hand he approached the cash register as thunder boomed
in the background.

Little did he know this was not thunder but the sounds of war. The walmart 
tribe had finally snapped and declared war on the target high city. 
Eddie was trapped with pancake mix and a small umbrella as the armies of 
walmart began their march. Eddie knew he had to warn the chairman of target.
Using the pancake mix he created a smoke screan and used the umbrella a sword.
He took out two of the scouts of the walmary armies. It was simple honesly...
using his discus skills from division three college track and field he could 
disable any attackers with a smaller than average melon.  

Eddie then had a change of thought and decided that Costco was by far the 
superior store and left the other stores to battle it out. He then went to
Costco, got a waffle iron, went home and made pancakes.
